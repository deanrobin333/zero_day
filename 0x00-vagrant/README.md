## Project Description
- Most of the projects in this program are supposed to be done in a Linux (Ubuntu) environment.

- For that matter, you will need to set up a similar environment for that purpose. It is for this reason
that we have the sandboxes but to be able to work locally even when you do not have internet
access, we highly recommend that you set up your own local coding environment.

- This project is therefore a guide for you to set up the necessary coding environment irrespective
of the operating system that you are using. Once you have set this up, you can stop using the
Sandboxes and just use your local environment.

# Tasks
#### 1
**0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account**
- You will need Git for this project, you might have to install it on your computer if it’s not done yet.{#custom-anchor}

- Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine – they will be part of your commits.
On GitHub.com:

- Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository (if it’s not done yet)
	- Description: `This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer`
	- Public repo: `zero_day`
	- No `README`, `.gitignore`, or license
- On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

	- Navigate to your home directory.
	- Create a directory `zero_day`.
	- Navigate to this new directory.
	- Initialize git and add the remote origin
	- Create a file `README.md` with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. **This file is mandatory in projects**
	- Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
---
#### 2
**1. Hello Ubuntu**
- Inside the `zero_day` repo, create a new directory called `0x00-vagrant`. Add a `README.md` file to this directory.

- `ssh` into your Ubuntu VM. What does the command `uname` print when you run it without any option?

- Type your answer into a file in the `0x00-vagrant` directory and push it to GitHub. Name your file accordingly as shown below.
